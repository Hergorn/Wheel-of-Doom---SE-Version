TUTORIAL

1. Create a custom widget inside your Overlay
2. Edit the custom widget
3. copy the code from the .txt files into the widget accordingly
  -> Inside this repository are 5 files named after the tabs of the widget
  -> HTML.txt > HTML Tab | CSS.txt > CSS tab | JS.txt > JS tab | FIELDS.txt > FIELDS tab | DATA.txt > DATA tab
4. apply changes
5. save your Overlay

Now you can edit the timer and challenges of the wheel

DIFFERENCES TO THE SELF HOSTED VERSION
-

You can't import and export your configs into XML files
  -> what you CAN do tho, is copy the DATA field into a .txt file (or whatever you want)
  -> If you want to import those settings just copy the text out of the previusly saved .txt file into DATA
